# Portfolio
Find here a collection of smaller coding projects, authored by me

## ASCII-art
Short Python skript to import and transform .jpg images to .txt files, aka. 
"ASCII-art".

## Cellular Automata
MATLAB skripts to showcase cellular automata, created during the lecture 
"Numerical Simulation Methods in Engineering". Features an [Elementary cellular 
automaton](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Elementary_cellular_automata)
for arbitrary Wolfram rules as well as an implementation of [Conway's Game of 
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
 

## Data Engineering Project
End of semester project of master module "Introduction to Engineering Data 
Analytics with R".

This case study consisted of importing, cleaning and merging a 7 GB data set of 
vehicle production data with R
before extracting information towards a specific research question and building 
a shiny app for presentation purposes.

As the data set is not available, the code can not be excecuted, but a thorough 
documentation can be found in the [.html file](
https://github.com/pweigmann/portfolio-projects/blob/master/Data%20Engineering%20Project/Case_Study_Gruppe_12.html) (in German).
This was a group project, my responsibility covering the coding, excluding the 
shiny app.
