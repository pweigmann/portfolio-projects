Find here a collection of smaller coding projects, authored by me

## ASCII-art
Short Python skript to import and transform .jpg images to .txt files, aka. "ASCII-art". 

## Data Engineering Project
End of semester project of master module "Introduction to Engineering Data Analytics with R".

This case study consisted of importing, cleaning and merging a 7 GB data set of vehicle production data with R
before extracting information towards a specific research question and building a shiny app for presentation purposes.

As the data set is not available, the code can not be excecuted, but a thorough documentation can be found in the .html file (in German).
This was a group project, my responsibility covering the coding, excluding the shiny app.
